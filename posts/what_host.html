<div class="main-content">
	A host is an organization responsible for providing an address service, ownership
	ledger and a public key directory for assets. 
	<br> <br>

	The host makes use of the <a href="/#ownership-block">ownership</a> block to describe and determine 
	ownership of a given stone. It can modify it, sign it and return a newly updated Stone. 
	<br><br> 

	<a href="#issuers">Issuers</a> of assets that do not require a third-party to manage 
	ownership can ignore the <a href="/#ownership-block">ownership</a> block. In this case, they would
	have to provide another mechanism to manage ownership of their assets.
	<br> <br> 
	
	The host must provide endpoints to receive and respond to commands from clients for basic operations like
	asset type creation, address creation, ownership change and verification, global asset locking, stone verification 
	and public key retrieval.
