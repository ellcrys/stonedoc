<div class="header" id="ownership">Ownership Block</div>
<div class="main-content">
	This block contains information about the ownership of a stone instance. 
	The host uses this block to store and determine ownership of an asset by associating 
	the stone with an address hosted with it. 
	<br> <br>

	Only the address owner who has access to the address's private
	key can authorize transactions against a stone belonging to it's address.
	<br><br>

	This block is optional. Only required when a host is needed to manage asset
	ownership. Otherwise, issuers can simply transfer unowned stones.
