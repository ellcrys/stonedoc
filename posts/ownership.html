<div class="header" id="ownership-block">Ownership Block</div>
<div class="main-content">
	This is an optional block containing information about the ownership of a stone instance. It is reserved 
	for the host to store and determine ownership of an asset by associating 
	the stone with an address known to it. 
	<br> <br>

	Only the address owner who has access to the address's private
	key can authorize transactions against a stone belonging to their address.
	<br><br>

	A stone without ownership information will be consider to be 
	an <i>unowned</i> asset by a host. Such an asset can be freely transferred by anyone
	to any address within the host.
