	A stone is represented in JSON format. It is made up of five properties know as "blocks". 
	The names of these blocks are 
	<b>meta</b>, <b>ownership</b>, <b>attributes</b>, <b>embeds</b> and <b>signatures</b>.

	<b>Meta</b>: The meta block is where the header information
	about the stone and it's issuer is stored. This block must be signed by
	the issuer during creation.
	<br><br>

	<b>Ownership</b>: An optional block for describing ownership. This block is used
	by the host to determine and describe ownership. It must be signed by the host.
	<br><br>

	<b>Attributes</b>: This is the only place an issuer can store arbitrary data about a
	stone instance. It must be signed by the issuer.
	<br><br>

	<b>Embeds</b>: To support complex stones, this block allows the issuer
	to include one or more stones inside of another stone. This is suitable for assets that 
	also come with additional assets. This block must be signed by the issuer.
	<br><br>

	<b>Signatures</b>: This is where the JWS signatures of the other blocks is
	stored. It is also the block that gets base64 encoded to make up the final stone token. 
	<br><br>

	Each block accepts an object containing expected properties. For a stone
	to be considered valid, all blocks must pass validation checks. The signatures block
	is excluded from the signing and verification processes.
