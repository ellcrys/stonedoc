<div class="main-content">

	As the world becomes more and more digital, the need for efficient systems to 
	allow for quick, easy and safe transfer of digital assets is increasing in demand. This has lead to
	the development of truly innovative technologies such as Bitcoin, Stellar, Ripple, Nxt and many more.
	<br><br>

	Many of these new technologies strive to be decentralized and trust-less at expense of cheap
	and easy scalability enjoyed by centralized systems. The difficulty in scaling
	such systems to meet the needs of millions of people could discourage users from transferring
	assets digitally. 
	<br><br>

	Stone is designed to be used by centralised systems in need of a way to describe simple or complex
	assets without having control over the issuance of these assets. Centralized transaction services
	using Stone will only offer an optional address system, public key store, transfer & verification services.
	<br><br>

	We hope that people interested in developing cryptographically secure, highly scalable, centralized digital 
	asset systems do so without needing to use complex technologies to achieve their objectives.
