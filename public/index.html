<div class="main-content">
	A "stone" is a cryptographically signed peice of data that is used as an object of value in centralized transactional sytems.
	It can be used to represent or store things of value. 
	<br> <br>

	It is designed to be real, portable and easy to transfer through everyday messaging systems such as email,
	sms, whatsapp etc.
	
	<br> <br>
	Some examples of 
	assets and valuables that can be represented or stored in a stone includes: 
	<br><br>
	<ul>
		<li>Digital money</li>
		<li>Coupons</li>
		<li>Vouchers</li>
		<li>Tickets</li>
		<li>Identity Information</li>
		<li>Commodities</li>
		<li>Copyrights</li>
		<li>Patents</li>
		<li>Certificates</li>
		<li>Binary Files</li>
	</ul>
	<br>

	A stone is made up of 5 parts known as <b>blocks</b>. They are <b>meta</b>, <b>ownership</b>, <b>attributes</b>, <b>embeds</b>
	and <b>signatures</b> blocks. All blocks are signed using <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515">JSON Web Signature</a> 
	standards with RSA-SHA256 algorithm.

	Data stored within a stone is signed by it <a href="#issuer">issuer</a>. It cannot be altered without
	the authorization of the issuer.
	<br><br>
</div>

				<div class="header" id="what-is-a-host">What is a Host</div>
<div class="main-content">
	A host is an organization responsible for providing an address service, ownership
	ledger and a public key directory for assets. 
	<br> <br>

	The host makes use of the <a href="/#ownership-block">ownership</a> block to describe and determine 
	ownership of a given stone. 
	As the only block accessible to the host, it can modify it, sign it and return a newly updated
	Stone. 
	<br><br> 

	<a href="#issuers">Issuers</a> of assets that do not require a central body to manage ownership or 
	prefers to manage ownership themselves can ignore the <a href="/#ownership-block">ownership</a> block and a host.
	<br> <br> 
	
	The host must provide endpoints to receive and respond to commands from clients for basic operations like
	asset type creation, address creation, ownership change and verification, global stone locking, stone verification 
	and public key retrieval.
	<br> <br> 

</div>

				<div class="header" id="why-stone">Why Stone</div>
<div class="main-content">

	As the world becomes more and more digital, the need for efficient systems to 
	allow for quick, easy and safe transfer of digital assets is increasing in demand. This has lead to
	the development of truly innovative technologies such as Bitcoin, Stellar, Ripple, Nxt and many more.
	<br><br>

	Many of these new technologies strive to be decentralized and trust-less at expense of cheap
	and easy scalability enjoyed by centralized systems. The difficulty in scaling
	such systems to meet the needs of millions of people could discourage users from transferring
	assets digitally. 
	<br><br>

	Stone is designed to be used by centralised systems in need of a way to describe simple or complex
	assets without having control over the issuance of these assets. Centralized transaction services
	using Stone will only offer an optional address system, public key store, transfer & verification services.
	<br><br>

	We hope that people interested in developing cryptographically secure, highly scalable, centralized digital 
	asset systems do so without needing to use complex technologies to achieve their objectives.
</div>

				<div class="header" id="address">Address</div>
<div class="main-content">
	An address is an important feature of a host that allows stones to be
	owned. A stone whose ownership information refers to
	an address is said to be owned by the address. <br><br> 

	Addresses are protected by RSA key pair, therefore all transaction relating to 
	the address must be signed and authorized by using the address's private key to sign
	transactions.


</div>

				<div class="header" id="issuer">Issuer</div>
<div class="main-content">
	An issuer is anyone who has registered an asset with the host and has
	access to the RSA key pair associated with the asset. 
	<br><br>

	Asset issuers are able to 
	create instances of their assets outside the host. Users
	can verify the authencity of an asset by pulling the asset public key 
	from the host. 
	<br><br>

	Issuers are responsible for signing the meta, attributes 
	and embeds blocks. 
</div>

				<div class="header" id="blocks">Blocks</div>
<div class="main-content">
	A stone is represented in JSON format. It is made up of five properties know as "blocks". 
	The names of these blocks are 
	<b>meta</b>, <b>ownership</b>, <b>attributes</b>, <b>embeds</b> and <b>signatures</b>.

	<b>Meta</b>: The meta block is where the header information
	about the stone and it's issuer is stored. This block must be signed by
	the issuer during creation.
	<br><br>

	<b>Ownership</b>: An optional block for describing ownership. This block is used
	by the host to determine and describe ownership. It must be signed by the host.
	<br><br>

	<b>Attributes</b>: This is the only place an issuer can store arbitrary data about a
	stone instance. It must be signed by the issuer.
	<br><br>

	<b>Embeds</b>: To support complex stones, this block allows the issuer
	to include one or more stones inside of a stone. This is suitable for assets that 
	also come with additional assets. This block must be signed by the issuer.
	<br><br>

	<b>Signatures</b>: This is where the JWS signatures of the other blocks is
	stored. It is also the block that gets base64 encoded to make up the final stone token. 
	<br><br>

	Each block accepts an object containing expected properties. For a stone
	to be considered valid, all blocks must pass validation checks. The signatures block
	is excluded from the signing and verification processes.
